#1)How much would the monthly payment be for a 30 year mortgage (30 * 12 = 360 month term) 
#with a 400,000 dollar principal and a 3% APR (interest rate with fees included)? 

#P=Principle (amount paid), R= intrest rate / 12, N= term (number of payments)

p= 400000
r= 0.03/12
n= 360

#EMI =
p * ((r*(1+r)**(n)) / ((1+r)**(n)-1)) 


#Monthly payment would be $1686.42
